Worked with Gabriel Bermudez Sellars on this Average Score project. 
Essentially, This program asks the user for a series of assignment scores and stores them in an array. It then generates an array of sorted scores in descending order using Selection Sort. Then, it asks the user for the number of (lowest) scores to drop and calculates the sum of remaining scores using a recursive algorithm. Finally, it uses the sum to calculate the average score (that does not include the dropped scores).
