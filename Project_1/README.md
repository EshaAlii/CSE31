Worked with Gabriel Bermudez Sellars on this Word Search project. 
Essentially, the program reads the puzzle grid from a text file and save it as a 2-D character array with the first number in the textfile indicating the size of the array. The program will then ask the user for the word to search and store it in the variable word. Then the program should then print the  original puzzle grid and, through recursion, search for the word in the puzzle. Finally, the program should output the search path matrix and tell the user if the word has been found.
